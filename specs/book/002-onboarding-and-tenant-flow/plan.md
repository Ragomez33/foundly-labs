# Implementation Plan: Foundly Book — Business Onboarding & Tenant Flow

**Branch**: `002-onboarding-and-tenant-flow` | **Date**: 2026-10-08 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/book/002-onboarding-and-tenant-flow/spec.md`

**Note**: Produced by `/speckit.plan`. Describes the technical approach and design artifacts for the `book` domain feature.

## Summary

Introduce the business-registration and tenancy layer of Foundly Book: a public product page (`/book`), a three-step onboarding wizard (`/book/onboarding`) that creates a **Tenant** (business) and its owner **User**, a tenant-scoped private dashboard (`/book/admin/*`) that reuses the existing Drawer shell, and a public booking portal addressed by the business's slug (`/book/[tenantSlug]`).

The feature is a Next.js (App Router) module inside `apps/book`, rendered server-first and composed from the **@foundly/ui** design system. The new tenancy domain (tenant, owner, slug, business hours, plan/license reference) is modelled as **pure TypeScript interfaces** and held in the **existing in-memory store seam**, which is extended with `tenants`, `users` and `sessions` collections. Slug validation, tenant resolution and provisioning are pure functions so they are testable in isolation. The onboarding wizard preserves its draft locally (local-first) and submits a single server action that provisions the tenant atomically. The module's public URLs are the multi-zone `/book/*` prefix; internally the app serves `/`, `/onboarding`, `/admin/*` and `/[tenantSlug]`.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript (strict), React 19, Next.js App Router (current stable), Node.js ≥ 20

**Primary Dependencies**: `@foundly/ui` (workspace, MUI v6) + `@mui/icons-material`; `@mui/material-nextjs` (`AppRouterCacheProvider`); Zod for input validation; Next.js routing (`next/navigation`, route groups, dynamic segments)

**Storage**: In-memory store (mock) behind the existing `apps/book/src/server/store.ts` seam, extended with `tenants`/`users`/`sessions`. The ecosystem's persistence strategy is **not yet defined** — no storage technology is introduced (per `specs/architecture.md`).

**Testing**: Vitest for pure tenancy logic (slug rules, tenant resolution, provisioning); Vitest + React Testing Library + `vitest-axe` for the wizard steps, the admin guard and the public portal

**Target Platform**: Web (server-rendered Next.js module, deployed as the `/book` multi-zone under a single domain)

**Project Type**: web application module (`apps/book`), no shared data package

**Performance Goals**: Product page and public portal resolve and render server-side in one round trip; slug resolution is a single indexed lookup in the store seam; the wizard's step transitions stay interactive (< 100 ms local validation)

**Constraints**: All UI from `@foundly/ui` with no ad-hoc brand styling; no `any`/unsafe casts; no app imports from `packages/*` beyond `@foundly/ui`; no persistence technology; SSR-safe; strict per-tenant data isolation; onboarding draft is local-first (survives reload/offline)

**Scale/Scope**: 4 surfaces (product page, wizard, admin dashboard, public portal); a 3-step wizard; tens of thousands of tenants; per-tenant services/rates/resources/availability/appointments from the existing admin panel

**Constraints introduced by gates**:

- **C1**: The product page, wizard, admin screens and public portal are built exclusively from `@foundly/ui` components; the admin shell reuses the token-styled MUI structure already established in `001-book-admin-panel`.
- **C2**: Tenancy logic (slug normalization/validation, reserved words, tenant resolution, provisioning defaults) contains no framework imports and no literal brand colors; it is a pure, unit-testable module.
- **C3**: No storage technology is introduced. The tenant/user/session data lives behind the single in-memory store seam; swapping it later must not change the tenancy logic or the views.
- **C4**: Every read/write of business data is scoped to the authenticated tenant from the session; the public portal resolves a tenant by slug and only exposes active/licensed businesses.
- **C5**: The wizard draft is local-first (client-persisted) and provisioning is a single idempotent action to avoid duplicates on retry.

**Structure Decision**: The feature lives entirely in `apps/book`. The private dashboard moves from the route group `(admin)` to a real `/admin` segment so that `/admin/*` is the authenticated surface while `/`, `/onboarding` and `/[tenantSlug]` remain public. Tenancy logic is isolated under `apps/book/src/domain/tenancy` (framework-free, C2) and all data access goes through the single store seam (C3). The existing 001 domain and views are reused unchanged except for tenant scoping. No shared data package is created.
