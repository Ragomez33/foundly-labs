# Contract: Route Map & access guards (Foundly Book)

**Feature**: `specs/book/002-onboarding-and-tenant-flow/` | **Date**: 2026-10-08

Fixes the module's four surfaces and the access boundary between public and private routes. It is a UI contract for `apps/book`; the `/book` public prefix is supplied by the multi-zone gateway (`specs/architecture.md` §2).

## Route map

| Surface             | Public URL                 | Internal App Router path        | Access            | Shell                |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Product page        | `/book`                    | `/`                             | public            | marketing layout     |
| Onboarding wizard   | `/book/onboarding`         | `/onboarding`                   | public            | wizard layout        |
| Private dashboard   | `/book/admin/*`            | `/admin/*`                      | authenticated     | `AdminShell` (Drawer)|
| Public booking      | `/book/<slug>`             | `/[tenantSlug]`                 | public            | portal layout        |

**Rules**:

- Static segments (`/`, `/onboarding`, `/admin/*`) MUST take precedence over the dynamic `[tenantSlug]` segment; reserved slugs MUST also be rejected at creation so a future tenant can never shadow a system surface (FR-006).
- `/admin/*` is the only authenticated surface. Its layout (`apps/book/src/app/admin/layout.tsx`) MUST run the `requireTenant` guard and render the `AdminShell`; unauthenticated access redirects to `/onboarding` (FR-016).
- The public portal resolves the tenant from `[tenantSlug]`; unknown, `draft` or `suspended` tenants render a "not available" state and MUST NOT expose data (FR-017).
- Booking on the portal creates an appointment with `origin: 'online'` (FR-018) and respects the availability engine.

## Guards

- `requireTenant(session): ActionResult<Session>` — rejects `UNAUTHENTICATED` / `FORBIDDEN`, mirrors the existing `requireRole` and derives `tenantId` from the session.
- Tenant scoping is enforced in every admin query/action; the URL never supplies the tenant id (C4, SC-008).

## Verification

- Route tests: `/admin/*` without a session redirects; `/onboarding` and `/` are public; reserved slugs are rejected; a random `[tenantSlug]` either resolves to an active tenant or renders the unavailable state.
- Isolation tests: a session of tenant A cannot read tenant B data.
