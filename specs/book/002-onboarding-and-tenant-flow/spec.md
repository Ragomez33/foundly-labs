# Feature Specification: Foundly Book — Business Onboarding & Tenant Flow

**Feature Branch**: `002-onboarding-and-tenant-flow`

**Created**: 2026-10-08

**Status**: Draft

**Input**: User description: "Crea una nueva spec que defina el flujo de registro de negocios y la estructura de rutas para Foundly Book: (1) Estructura de rutas: `/book` (landing informativa del producto Foundly Book con features y CTA para registrar negocio), `/book/onboarding` (wizard paso a paso para crear negocio/servicio), `/book/admin/*` (dashboard privado del negocio, el layout con Drawer ya construido) y `/book/[tenantSlug]` (portal público donde los clientes finales agendan sus citas). (2) Onboarding en 3 pasos: Paso 1 datos de la cuenta (Nombre, Email, Password); Paso 2 datos del negocio (Nombre comercial, Slug/URL pública, Categoría); Paso 3 configuración inicial (Duración por defecto de citas, Horario de atención general). (3) Entidades/Mock Schema: definir los tipos de TypeScript para `Tenant` (Negocio) y `User` alineados con el enfoque local-first/mock state."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Register a business through the onboarding wizard (Priority: P1)

As a business owner, I want to sign up and create my business through a short guided wizard so that I end up with a ready-to-use booking workspace without any technical setup.

**Why this priority**: Registration and provisioning are the entry point of Foundly Book. Until a tenant (business) and its owner exist, no agenda, catalog or availability can be used, so this is the foundation of the module's value.

**Independent Test**: Starting from the product page, complete the three wizard steps with valid data and confirm that a business and its owner account are created, the initial configuration is provisioned, and the owner lands in the private workspace.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor on the registration entry point, **When** they open the wizard, **Then** they see three ordered steps (account, business, initial configuration) and their progress is visible.
2. **Given** step 1, **When** the owner enters a name, a valid email and an acceptable password, **Then** they can continue to step 2; otherwise the step blocks progress and shows an inline error for each invalid field.
3. **Given** step 2, **When** the owner enters a commercial name, chooses a public URL (slug) and a category, **Then** the wizard verifies that the public URL is available, valid and not reserved before allowing progress.
4. **Given** step 3, **When** the owner sets the default appointment duration and the general business hours, **Then** those values are ready to be applied to the new workspace.
5. **Given** a completed wizard, **When** the owner confirms creation, **Then** the business and its owner account are created, the chosen defaults are provisioned, and the owner is taken to the private dashboard.
6. **Given** a partially completed wizard, **When** the owner navigates back or the page is reloaded, **Then** previously entered data is preserved (local-first) and no step is lost.

### User Story 2 - Book an appointment on a business's public page (Priority: P2)

As a final client, I want to open a business's public page and book one of its services online so that I can reserve an appointment without calling or messaging the business.

**Why this priority**: The public portal is the main value the business gets from registering; it turns the agenda into real bookings. It depends on a tenant existing first.

**Independent Test**: Open the public page of an existing active business, choose a service and an available slot, confirm the booking, and verify the appointment appears in that business's agenda.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an active business with a public URL, **When** a client opens its public page, **Then** they see the business identity (name and category) and its bookable services.
2. **Given** a requested service, **When** the client picks a date, **Then** only slots that respect the business hours, its availability and existing appointments are offered.
3. **Given** a valid slot, **When** the client confirms with their details, **Then** an appointment is created for that business with an "online" origin and enters its initial lifecycle state.
4. **Given** an unknown or inactive business URL, **When** a client opens it, **Then** they see a clear "not available" state and no business data is exposed.

### User Story 3 - Use the private workspace of my business (Priority: P2)

As an owner or professional, I want every private screen to operate inside my own business's workspace so that I only see and manage my own agenda, services and availability.

**Why this priority**: The dashboard already exists as a shell; this story establishes tenant scoping and access control, which are required before any real business uses it.

**Independent Test**: Sign in as an owner, open the private dashboard, and confirm all screens reflect the owner's business and that direct access without a session (or across businesses) is blocked.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated owner, **When** they open the private dashboard, **Then** the shell (brand, navigation, user profile) renders and all screens are scoped to their business.
2. **Given** a request to a private screen without a valid session, **When** it is made, **Then** the owner is redirected to the registration/sign-in entry point.
3. **Given** a user of business A, **When** they try to reach data of business B, **Then** access is denied and no business B data is shown.

---

### User Story 4 - Learn about Foundly Book from its product page (Priority: P3)

As a prospective customer, I want an informative page that explains what Foundly Book does so that I can decide to register my business.

**Why this priority**: The product page drives acquisition, but it only refines an already working registration and booking flow.

**Independent Test**: Open the product page and confirm it presents the module's capabilities and a clear path to register a business.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor, **When** they open the product page, **Then** they see the module's key capabilities (agenda, services, availability, online booking) and a prominent call to action.
2. **Given** the call to action, **When** the visitor activates it, **Then** they are taken to the registration wizard.
3. **Given** pricing or licensing information, **When** it is shown, **Then** it matches the ratified Foundly Pass model and no unapproved price is displayed.

### Edge Cases

- A public URL (slug) is already taken, is a reserved word (e.g. `admin`, `onboarding`, `api`, `www`), or contains invalid characters; the wizard must suggest alternatives and block progress until a valid one is chosen.
- The email used in step 1 is already associated with an account.
- The password does not meet the minimum strength policy.
- The wizard is abandoned midway or the connection drops; entered data must not be lost and the owner must be able to resume.
- Two different businesses share the same commercial name; they must still get distinct public URLs.
- A business changes its public URL after launch; the previous URL must not silently serve another business.
- A client opens the public page of a suspended or unlicensed business; the page must show an unavailable state and expose no data.
- A client tries to book a slot that was taken between viewing and confirming; the booking must be rejected and alternatives offered.
- A client books across the business's booking horizon or below any minimum lead time; the slot must not be offered.
- The owner registers while offline (local-first); the account and business creation must not be lost once connectivity returns.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Route Structure

The module MUST expose four distinct surfaces, mapped onto the ecosystem's single-domain multi-zone deployment:

| Surface                | Public path (through the gateway) | Purpose                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product page           | `/book`                           | Informative page about Foundly Book, its capabilities and the register CTA |
| Onboarding wizard      | `/book/onboarding`                | Step-by-step creation of a business and its owner account               |
| Private dashboard      | `/book/admin/*`                   | Authenticated workspace (agenda, services, availability) inside the Drawer shell |
| Public booking portal  | `/book/[tenantSlug]`              | Client-facing page where final clients book appointments                |

### Functional Requirements

**Routing & surfaces**

- **FR-001**: The module MUST provide a public product page that describes Foundly Book's capabilities and presents a call to action to register a business.
- **FR-002**: The product page's call to action MUST lead to the onboarding wizard.
- **FR-003**: The module MUST provide an onboarding wizard that creates a business and its owner account in three ordered steps.
- **FR-004**: The module MUST provide a private dashboard reachable only through the `/book/admin/*` surface, rendered inside the existing application shell (brand, navigation and user profile).
- **FR-005**: The module MUST provide a public booking portal addressed by the business's public URL (slug), reachable without signing in.
- **FR-006**: The router MUST reserve certain slugs (e.g. `admin`, `onboarding`, `api`, `www`, `app`) so that no business can claim a path that collides with a system surface.

**Onboarding — step 1 (account)**

- **FR-007**: Step 1 MUST collect the owner's full name, email and password, and MUST validate email format and a minimum password strength before allowing progress.

**Onboarding — step 2 (business)**

- **FR-008**: Step 2 MUST collect the commercial name, the desired public URL (slug) and a category, and MUST validate that the slug is well-formed, available and not reserved.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST derive a suggested slug from the commercial name while allowing the owner to edit it.

**Onboarding — step 3 (initial configuration)**

- **FR-010**: Step 3 MUST collect a default appointment duration and a general business-hours schedule, and MUST validate them (positive duration; hours with an end after the start).

**Provisioning & flow**

- **FR-011**: Completing the wizard MUST create exactly one business and one owner account bound to it, and MUST provision the business's initial configuration (default duration, working hours, currency and timezone defaults).
- **FR-012**: After successful creation, the owner MUST be taken to the private dashboard of the new business.
- **FR-013**: The wizard MUST preserve entered data across step navigation, page reloads and connectivity loss (local-first), and MUST prevent duplicate submissions.
- **FR-014**: The system MUST prevent creating two businesses with the same public URL, and MUST keep the mapping from public URL to business unique and stable.

**Tenant scope & access**

- **FR-015**: Every private dashboard screen MUST operate strictly within the authenticated owner's business, with no cross-business data displayed.
- **FR-016**: Access to private surfaces without a valid session MUST be denied and redirected to the registration/sign-in entry point.
- **FR-017**: The public portal MUST resolve the business by its public URL and MUST expose only active/licensed businesses; unknown, suspended or unlicensed businesses MUST show an unavailable state with no data exposed.
- **FR-018**: The public portal MUST offer only slots that respect the business's hours, availability, duration and existing appointments, and MUST create bookings with an "online" origin.

**Governance & data approach**

- **FR-019**: The feature MUST respect `specs/business-model.md` (Foundly Book module definition §2.3 and the Foundly Pass licensing/SSO rules §3) and MUST NOT display unratified pricing.
- **FR-020**: Consistent with the ecosystem's local-first principle and the deferred persistence decision, the feature MUST model and hold its data as typed in-memory/mock state behind a single seam, without introducing any storage technology.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Tenant (Negocio)**: A registered business that owns an agenda. Key attributes: internal identifier; commercial name; public URL slug; category; status (draft, active, suspended); default appointment duration; general business hours schedule; default currency and timezone; owner reference; created-at.
- **User**: An account able to sign in and administer a business. Key attributes: internal identifier; full name; email (unique); credential; role (owner/administrator, professional); business reference; status; created-at.
- **Business hours schedule**: The tenant's general opening hours, expressed as one interval per weekday (start/end) plus closed days; used to seed availability on provisioning.
- **Public URL (slug)**: The unique, human-readable identifier that addresses a tenant's portal; constrained by format, uniqueness and the reserved-word list.

**Relationships**: A User owns/manages exactly one Tenant in this version (a Tenant has one owner, with room for additional staff roles later); a Tenant is the root of the module's existing data (services, rates, resources, availability rules, time blocks and appointments), which are all scoped to it; the public portal resolves a Tenant from its slug and creates Appointments with an "online" origin.

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A new owner can go from the product page to a provisioned private dashboard in under 5 minutes.
- **SC-002**: At least 90% of owners who start the wizard complete it on the first attempt without abandoning.
- **SC-003**: 100% of created businesses have a unique, valid, non-reserved public URL.
- **SC-004**: 100% of public portals for active businesses expose bookable availability, and 0% of unknown, suspended or unlicensed businesses expose any data.
- **SC-005**: A newly provisioned workspace reflects the wizard's default duration and business hours with 0 manual setup steps.
- **SC-006**: 0% of onboarding data is lost on step navigation, page reload or connectivity drop (local-first draft).
- **SC-007**: 0 critical accessibility violations across the four surfaces; every registration, sign-in, booking and dashboard flow is fully keyboard-operable.
- **SC-008**: 0 cross-business data exposures in private dashboard screens across repeated access attempts.

## Assumptions

- **Governance**: Governed by `specs/business-model.md` (maximum authority) — specifically the Foundly Book module definition (§2.3) and the Foundly Pass licensing/SSO rules (§3); plus `constitution.md`, `specs/architecture.md`, `specs/system-design.md` and `code-rules.md`. This spec MUST be created under the `book` domain per `constitution.md` §2.
- **Deployment mapping**: The shared domain maps the public `/book/*` prefix onto `apps/book` internal routes (multi-zone, per `specs/architecture.md` §2); the paths above are the public URLs seen by users.
- **Relationship to the admin panel**: This feature builds on the existing private admin panel (`001-book-admin-panel`); the private dashboard reuses its shell (Drawer navigation, brand and user profile) and its agenda/services/availability screens, now tenant-scoped.
- **Identity**: Foundly Pass is the ecosystem's centralized identity provider. For this version, the onboarding captures the owner's credentials/identity into the local-first mock state and the concrete `Tenant` and `User` TypeScript interfaces follow the same plain-interface + in-memory-store approach as the existing book domain; no authentication or storage technology is adopted yet.
- **Persistence**: No storage technology is defined or implied (deferred per `specs/architecture.md`); drafts and created entities live in typed in-memory/mock state behind a single seam.
- **Public booking**: Final clients do not need a Foundly account to book in this version (guest booking); the portal is read-and-book only and exposes no private business data.
- **Ownership model**: One owner account per business in v1; multiple staff/professional roles are a later concern.
- **Defaults**: New businesses default to the ecosystem's reference currency (`EUR`) and a single business timezone (consistent with the existing book domain), and default to guest-visible, online bookings enabled.
- **Localization**: All surfaces are delivered in Spanish, matching the rest of the ecosystem.
- **Category**: The category is chosen from a predefined list with the possibility of a free-form value in this version.
- **Reserved slugs**: A fixed reserved list (e.g. `admin`, `onboarding`, `api`, `www`, `app`) is maintained to prevent collisions with system surfaces.
